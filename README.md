## About Project

This project is a **Digital Banking** web application developed using **Spring Boot** for the backend, and **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization, and **Angular** and **Bootstrap 5** for the frontend. It is a user-friendly CRUD website that allows managing customers and their accounts, as well as performing banking operations such as credit, debit, transfers and viewing account operations. The Customer Profile section allows customers to view and update their profile, and perform transfers between accounts. The frontend communicates with the backend using **RESTful APIs** to exchange data efficiently.
